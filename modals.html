                    Playing Christmas Bingo is the perfect opportunity to bring your family together. 
                    <i class="fa fa-heart-o heart-icon" aria-hidden="true"></i><br>
                    In any Bingo game we have different Bingo-sheets to choose from.
                    You buy one, go home, stare at your TV <i class="fa fa-television" aria-hidden="true"></i> and wait for the numbers, right? :D 
                    Now, if you would want to play at home with friends, one would have to read random numbers 
                    and the rest of you would have to circle them (when you spot them on your Bingo sheet).<br>
                    Weeeeeeell, I have made a way for all of you to play.
                    Just imagine the same game but with Christmas pictures instead of numbers. 

                    In the spirit of Christmas <i class="fa fa-snowflake-o snowflake-icon" aria-hidden="true"></i> and other New Year Holidays 
                    <i class="fa fa-tree tree-icon" aria-hidden="true"></i> you can choose from 3 different Bingo Sheets. 
                    Download the file <i class="fa fa-download download-icon" aria-hidden="true"></i> and print it. 
                    Cut the sheets and let each person choose one. Then just click on the "Generate" button and mark the items you see with those 
                    you have in your sheet. The winner is the first player to achieve a winning pattern and call out "Bingo!".<br>
                    <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> If you want to play a short game: The winning pattern could be any straight line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).<br>
                    <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> If you want to play medium-length game: The winning pattern could be any two intersecting straight lines.<br>
                    <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> If you want to play a long game: The winning pattern could be to mark off every square on the bingo card.<br>
                    <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> If you have lots of players, and want to have multiple winners: You could have multiple winning patterns - 
                    the first winner is the first player to mark off all four corner squares, the second winner is the first player to get a straight line, 
                    the third winner is the first player to get two intersecting lines, and the fourth winner is the player who is first to mark off all the squares 
                    on their bingo card.<br>
                    <br><br>BINGO MARKERS
                    Thereâ€™s tons of bingo marker options for this holiday bingo set. 
                    We typically use candy because it is the easiest and, obviously, 
                    we all enjoy it!  Some of my favorite candy options are:
                    <li>Individually wrapped Hershey kisses</li>
                    <li>Wrapped peppermints (or other candies)</li> 
                    <li>Red and green M&Ms</li><br>
                    NON-CANDY BINGO MARKER OPTIONS<br>
                    <li>Holiday erasers</li>
                    <li>Bells</li>
                    <li>Noodles (can even be dyed red and green)</li><br>
                    Now go download that sheet and play the game!
